Reading comprehension for ML
------------------------------------------------
*Download* and edit this file, `cqs-ml.txt`, to answer the questions
below.  Once you've edited the file, submit it by uploading it to the
homework server and running command `submit105-cqs`.

 1. Read section 5.1 of [Harper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/isml/book.pdf) 
    about tuple types and tuple patterns.  Also look at the list
    examples in sections 9.1 and 9.2 of Harper.

    Now consider the pattern `(x::y::zs, w)`. For each of the following
    expressions, tell whether the pattern matches the value denoted. If
    the pattern matches, say what values are bound to the four variables
    `x`, `y`, `zs`, and `w`. If it does not match, explain why not.

    (a) `([1, 2, 3], ("COMP", 105))`
    (b) `(("COMP", 105), [1, 2, 3])`
    (c) `([("COMP", 105)], (1, 2, 3))`
    (d) `(["COMP", "105"], true)`
    (e) `([true, false], 2.718281828)`

    Answers here:

    (a) x = 1
        y = 2
        zs = [3, '()]
        w = ("COMP", 105)

    (b) Doesn't match

    (c) Doesn't match

    (d) x = "COMP"
        y = 105
        zs = '()
        w = true

    (e) x = true
        y = false
        zs = '()
        w = 2.718281828

    _You are starting to be ready to use pattern matching._


 2. Read the descriptions of patterns and example values (steps 3 and 2)
    in the fourth "[Lesson in Program Design]{canvas=lessons.pdf}."
    Look at Table 4.1, including the *Types of parts* column.  Using
    the ideas you find there, prepare to answer questions about this
    expression:
    
        case f (x, y, z) 
          of []      => raise Empty
           | w :: ws => if p w then SOME w else NONE

    You are told that the subexpression `f (x, y, z)` has type
    `'a list`.  Using that information, give the type of each of these
    code fragments, which are built from parts of patterns: 

    (a) The type of the pattern `w :: ws`

        → cons

    (b) The type of the variable `ws`

        → list

    (c) The type of the expression `SOME w`

        → option

    _You are ready to use pattern matching on common ML types._



 3. Read the section on unit testing in the [guide to learning
    ML]{canvas=learning-ml.pdf}.  Read about infix function names in step 3 
    of the fourth [lesson on program design]{canvas=lessons.pdf}.
    And read the section on [unit testing](#unit-testing) in this homework.

    Now, using the interpreter to be sure your answer is well typed,
    translate the following _failing_ unit test into ML:
    
        (check-expect (foldl + 0 '(1 2 3)) 7)
    
    Your translation:

    → val () =
        Unit.checkExpectWith Int.toString "1 + 2 + 3 != 7"
        (fn () => foldl + 0 [1, 2, 3]) 
        7

    _You are ready to write unit tests._


 4. In chapter 5 of *Programming Languages: Build, Prove, and Compare*,
    study the definition of function `bindList` in chunk 312c.
    Now show a call to `bindList` that is well typed (passes type
    checking) but whose evaluation raises the `BindListLength` exception:
    
    > bindList ([x, [2, x]], [3, [x. y]], emptyEnv);
    
    (Hint: keep things simple by passing `emptyEnv` as the third argument.)

    _You are ready to write `zip` and to write environment
    functions that use exceptions._


 5. "Free" variables are those that are not bound to a value in the
    current scope. You can find a longer discussion and precise
    definition in section 5.6 of *Build, Prove, and Compare*, 
    which starts on page 322. Read the section and identify the
    free variables of the expressions below.  *Remember that a name
    occurring in function position can be a free variable.*

     (a) Free variables of `(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (equal? x y)))`

         → equal?

     (b) Free variables of `(lambda (y) (equal? x y))`

         → equal?, x

     (c) Free variables of

             (lambda (s1 s2)
               (if (or (atom? s1) (atom? s2))
                 (= s1 s2)
                 (and (equal? (car s1) (car s2))
                      (equal? (cdr s1) (cdr s2)))))

         → or, and, equal?, atom?, car, cdr

    _You are ready to improve the μScheme interpreter._ You may do
    this with a partner.  You and your partner will turn your answers
    to parts (a) and (b) into unit tests.
