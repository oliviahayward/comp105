*Download* and edit this file, `cqs-hofs.txt`, to answer the questions
below.  Once you've edited the file, submit it by uploading it to the
homework server and running command `submit105-cqs`.

 1. Revisit the definition of values in figure 2.1 on page 93.
    Next, study the definition of the predefined function `all?` in 
    section 2.8.3, which starts on page 131.  Like many
    higher-order functions, `all?` has a subtle contract: it is
    permissible to call `(all? p? xs)` if and only if there exists a
    set $A$ such that following are true:
    
      - Parameter `p?` is a function that accepts one argument, which
        must be a member of $A$.  Then `p?` returns a Boolean.
        
      - Parameter `xs` is in *LIST(A)*.  That is, `xs` is a list of
        values, and every element of `xs` is a member of $A$.
        
    In other words, `xs` must be a list of values, each of which may
    be passed to `p?`.
    
    With this contract in mind, answer these questions:
    
    (a) Write a value that is never permissible as the second,
        `xs` argument to `all?`, no matter what `p?` is:

        > (lambda (x) (* x x))

    (b) Write a value *made with `cons`* that is never permissible as
        the second, `xs` argument to `all?`, no matter what `p?` is:

        > (cons (foldr + 2 '(1 2 3)) (lambda (x) (* x x)))

    (c) Write a value that may or may not be permissible as the
        second, `xs` argument to `all?`, depending on what `p?` is.
        Your value should be *permissible* if `p?` is `number?`, but
        *impermissible* if `p?` is `prime?`:

        > 

    (An impermissible call might or might not result in a checked
    run-time error.)



 2. Study the description of function `list-of?` in problem **L** in
    the homework, and also the hints for that problem.  Suppose you
    are given a predicate `even?` whose contract says it accepts a
    number and returns a Boolean saying if the number is even.  The
    following call to `list-of?` is a contract violation:

        (list-of? even? '(1 2 3 oopsie))
        
    Explain how `list-of?`'s contract is violated, and assign blame to
    one of the two arguments: the first or the second:
    
    > The first argument violates `list-of?`'s contract because evens? only
    takes in integers.

    Now, assume that you are given a predicate `prime-number?`, which
    accepts *any* value and returns a Boolean saying whether the value
    is both a number and prime.  For each value of `xs` that you
    listed in question 1, answer whether passing the value to
    `list-of?`, along with the predicate `prime-number?`, violates
    `list-of?`'s contract---and if not, what result `list-of?` should
    return.
    
    (a) Does the value you wrote in 1(a) violate the contract?

        > no
        
        If not, what does `(list-of? prime-number? xs)` return?

        > #f

    (b) Does the value you wrote in 1(b) violate the contract?

        > no
        
        If not, what does `(list-of? prime-number? xs)` return?

        > #f
        
    (c) Does the value you wrote in 1(c) violate the contract?

        > no
        
        If not, what does `(list-of? prime-number? xs)` return?

        > 

    _You are ready for problem **L**._



 3. Section 2.11.4, which starts on page 153, describes the semantics
    of the true definition forms.  Use the semantics to answer two
    questions about the following sequence of definitions:

        (val f (lambda () y))
        (val y 10)
        (f)

    We know that evaluating `lambda` in an environment ρ creates a
    closure using that same ρ. if the definitions above are evaluated
    in an environment in which `y` ∈ dom ρ, then what is the result of
    the call to `f`? Pick A, B, or C.

      (A) It returns `10`.
      (B) An error is raised: `Run-time error: name y not found`.
      (C) It returns whatever value `y` had before the definitions
          were evaluated.

        > A

    If the definitions above are evaluated in an environment in which
    `y` ∉ dom ρ, what is the result of the call to `f`? 
    Pick either A or B.

      (A) It returns `10`.
      (B) An error is raised: `Run-time error: name y not found`.

        > B
    *You are ready to start problem 46.*



 4. Read the description of Boolean formulas in the section
    "Representing Boolean formulas" of the homework.  Then revisit the
    description of μScheme's records in the textbook
    in section 2.4, which starts on page 109, or in the
    recitation on higher-order functions.  (Or if you prefer, read
    section 2.13.6, which starts on page 169, which shows how records
    are implemented.)  Now assume you are given a formula f₀, 
    and answer these questions:
    
    (a) How, in constant time, do you tell if f₀ has the form `(make-not f)`?

        > (not? f₀)
        
    (b) How, in constant time, do you tell if f₀ has the form `(make-and fs)`?

        > (and? f₀)

    (c) How, in constant time, do you tell if f₀ has the form `(make-or fs)`?

        > (or? f₀)

    *You are ready to start problems L and F.*



 5. Read the definition of evaluation in problem E in the homework,
    including the definition of the environment used by `eval-formula`.

    Each of the following Boolean formulas is evaluated in an
    environment where `x` is `#t`, `y` is `#f`, and `z` is `#f`.
    What is the result of evaluating each formula?
    (For each formula, answer `#t`, "true", `#f`, or "false.")

    (a) $x$, which in μScheme is constructed by `'x`

        > #t

    (b) $¬x$, which in μScheme is constructed by `(make-not 'x)`

        > #f

    (c) $¬y ∧ x$, which in μScheme is constructed by
         `(make-and (list2 (make-not 'y) 'x))`

        > #t

    (d) $¬x ∨ y ∨ z$, which in μScheme is constructed by
         `(make-or (list3 (make-not 'x) 'y 'z))`

        >  #f

    (e) Formula `(make-not (make-or (list1 'z)))`, which has a
        tricky `make-or` applied to a list of length 1, and so can't
        be written using infix notation
    
        > #t

    *You are ready to start problem E.*



 6. Read about the Boolean-satisfaction problem for CNF formulas
    in section 2.10.2, which starts on page 140.
    The rules for satisfaction, which in the third paragraph (just
    after the CNF grammar), are the same for all Boolean formulas,
    even those that are not in CNF.
    
    For each of the following Boolean formulas, if there is an
    assignment to `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfies the formula,
    write the words "is solved by" and a satisfying assignment.
    Incomplete assignments are OK.  If there is no satisfying
    assignment, write the words "has no solution."
    
    Examples:
    
    $x ∨ y ∨ z$, which in μScheme is constructed by `(make-or '(x y z))`,
    is solved by `'((x #t))`
    
    $x ∧ y ∧ z$, which in μScheme is constructed by `(make-and '(x y z))`,
    is solved by `'((x #t) (y #t) (z #t))`
    
    $x ∧ ¬x$, which in μScheme is constructed by
    `(make-and (list2 'x (make-not 'x)))`, has no solution

    For each of these formulas, replace the ellipsis with your answer:
    
    (a) $(x ∨ ¬x) ∧ y$, which in μScheme is constructed by  
        `(make-and (list2 (make-or (list2 'x (make-not 'x))) 'y))`,  

        > is solved by '((x #t) (y #t))

    
    (b) $(x ∨ ¬x) ∧ ¬x$, which in μScheme is constructed by  
        `(make-and (list2 (make-or (list2 'x (make-not 'x))) (make-not 'x)))`,  

        > is solved by '((x #f))

    (c) $(x ∨ y ∨ z) ∧ (¬x ∧ x) ∧ (x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z)$,
        which in μScheme is constructed by

            (make-and 
                (list3 (make-or (list3 'x 'y 'z)) 
                       (make-and (list2 (make-not 'x) 'x))
                       (make-or (list3 'x (make-not 'y) (make-not 'z))))))

        > no solution


    *You are ready to start problems S and T.*
